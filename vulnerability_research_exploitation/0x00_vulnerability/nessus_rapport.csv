    unauthenticated, remote attacker can exploit this, via a
    specially crafted packet, to disclose sensitive
    information. (CVE-2017-0147)

ETERNALBLUE, ETERNALCHAMPION, ETERNALROMANCE, and ETERNALSYNERGY are
four of multiple Equation Group vulnerabilities and exploits disclosed
on 2017/04/14 by a group known as the Shadow Brokers. WannaCry /
WannaCrypt is a ransomware program utilizing the ETERNALBLUE exploit,
and EternalRocks is a worm that utilizes seven Equation Group
vulnerabilities. Petya is a ransomware program that first utilizes
CVE-2017-0199, a vulnerability in Microsoft Office, and then spreads
via ETERNALBLUE.","Microsoft has released a set of patches for Windows Vista, 2008, 7,
2008 R2, 2012, 8.1, RT 8.1, 2012 R2, 10, and 2016. Microsoft has also
released emergency patches for Windows operating systems that are no
longer supported, including Windows XP, 2003, and 8.

For unsupported Windows operating systems, e.g. Windows XP, Microsoft
recommends that users discontinue the use of SMBv1. SMBv1 lacks
security features that were included in later SMB versions. SMBv1 can
be disabled by following the vendor instructions provided in Microsoft
KB2696547. Additionally, US-CERT recommends that users block SMB
directly by blocking TCP port 445 on all network boundary devices. For
SMB over the NetBIOS API, block TCP ports 137 / 139 and UDP ports 137
/ 138 on all network boundary devices.","http://www.nessus.org/u?68fc8eff
